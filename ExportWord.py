Chapter 274 Root of All Evil 2

Part 1

“Cry, somehow...... It has been a really long time since you came here!” (Luke)

Luke, covered in blood, mutters emotionally. I have no idea why, but he seems to be in a very good mood.

It looked terrible from the air, but Thawne’s training ground looked absolutely terrible.? I have absolutely no idea what happened, but the sight of the broken steeple, the gates reduced to rubble, and deep cracks running here and there make my stomach sick.

I had no idea what was going on, but countless gazes pierced me. The disciples of the honored 《Sword Saint (Kensei)》, who had been lying on the ground, rose up with zombie-like movements.

I seriously have no clue what’s going on, but for some reason, the bloody Luke seems to be going strong. I seriously have no clue what’s going on at all, seriously none at all!!

Lucia sighs deeply and holds her forehead. She is probably thinking about how she has to clean up again. You have to clean up the mess, you know....... If you let Luke clean up, it will become a big mess again.

Well, one bad thing for the greater good, for the greater good! When I hit on Lucia’s back, our rampaging swordsman yelled out in high spirits with *kirakira* sparkling eyes.

“Lately, the number of people who have mock battles with me has been decreasing, and my sword just wanted to drink some blood. So Cry, thank you! Forever!” (Luke)

“No thank you, forever, yeaaah!” (Cry)

He gives me a high-five pose, so I clap his high-five as I get swept away.

I am glad you are having fun...... And after all, the blood Luke is bathed in seems to belong to someone else’s. I gave him a wooden sword so he doesn’t cut people unnecessarily, but what’s the point if he cuts people with it anyway!

However, this tsukkomi has been around for a while. Causing a lot of damage and troubling the 《Sword Saint (Kensei)》 is also no new news. Ordinary people die if they are cut and bleed heavily, but the endurance of a swordsman who has absorbed Mana Material reaches an inhuman level. If there were any deaths, they would have condemned him more, so I guess they barely escaped death this time.

I was in a panic at first, but I got used to it. Swordsmen are really tough.

For the time being, as his friend, I will verify how he is.

“Are you hurt?” (Cry)

“Naaah, no problem. I avoided most of them, and if I had to say, I’d say the only big wound was this one.” (Luke)

“!! My-My apologies. It is...... It is just that she is, too beautiful............” (Nadori)

Luke’s senior disciple who was standing directly in front of him, said with a hardened expression on his face.

............ Huh? I unintentionally looked at Lucia, but she also blinked her eyes in wonder.

This is the first time I have seen this pattern, so I don’t know how to deal with it, but――――I fearfully called out to him.

“.................. You know that telling the truth is not a compliment, right?” (Cry)

“!? Ni-Nii-san!?” (Lucia)

The disciples were stunned. Huh? Is it possible that just like Martis-san is weak against Tino, these people are weak against Lucia?

What’s up with these guys, they look like a bunch of rough people, but they have a pretty cute side too.? I say while *bambam” slapping his back in a friendly manner.

“You didn’t have enough mental training.” (Cry)

“............ Ugh...... So-Sorry............” (Nadori)

“............ That’s why Luke cut you down.” (Cry)

“!? Th-That has nothing to do with――” (Nadori)

Next time I get a complaint here, I will bring Lucia with me. But still, for you to be unable to move just because of one single girl, your tolerance is too low.

I think I heard him say that mental and physical training is the basis of a swordsman, but he did not train enough at all. Well, I can’t say anything about it because there are people like Luke who are very strong despite fatally lacking one of these things.
