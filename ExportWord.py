If you're working with tables in your Word document and using Python with the `python-docx` library, you can extract data from the tables by iterating over the rows and cells in the table. Below is an example of how you can extract the checkbox states from a table in a Word document:

### Python Code to Extract Checkbox States from Tables

```python
from docx import Document
import os

# Function to check the checkbox state
def get_checkbox_state(cell_text):
    if "☒" in cell_text:
        return "Checked"
    elif "☐" in cell_text:
        return "Unchecked"
    else:
        return "Not Found"

# Function to process each Word document
def process_document(doc_path):
    document = Document(doc_path)
    search_string = "Is the customer information public/anonymized/encrypted in a secure manner, such that the identities of customers cannot be readily inferred?"
    yes_state = "Not Found"
    no_state = "Not Found"
    
    # Iterate through all tables in the document
    for table in document.tables:
        for row in table.rows:
            for cell in row.cells:
                if search_string in cell.text:
                    # Assume that the "Yes" and "No" checkboxes are in the next cells in the row
                    for i in range(len(row.cells)):
                        if search_string in row.cells[i].text:
                            yes_state = get_checkbox_state(row.cells[i + 1].text)
                            no_state = get_checkbox_state(row.cells[i + 2].text)
                            break
                    break

    return yes_state, no_state

# Main function to loop through all documents
def main(folder_path):
    results = []
    for filename in os.listdir(folder_path):
        if filename.endswith(".docx"):
            filepath = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)
            yes_state, no_state = process_document(filepath)
            results.append((filename, yes_state, no_state))
    
    # Print the results or save them to Excel
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Set the folder path and call the main function
folder_path = r"C:\Your\Folder\Path"  # Update this path
main(folder_path)
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Checkbox State Detection**: The `get_checkbox_state` function checks if the text in a cell contains the "☒" or "☐" symbols, which represent checked and unchecked checkboxes, respectively.

2. **Table Processing**: The `process_document` function iterates over all the tables in the document. For each table, it looks through each row and cell to find the specific search string. Once the string is found, it assumes the "Yes" and "No" checkbox cells are adjacent to the cell containing the search string.

3. **Document Processing**: The `main` function loops through all the Word documents in the specified folder, processes each document, and stores the results in a list of tuples.

4. **Output**: The results are printed to the console, but you can modify the script to save them to an Excel file if needed.

### Notes:

- **Document Structure**: This code assumes that the "Yes" and "No" checkboxes are in the same row as the search string and located in adjacent cells. If the structure is different, you may need to adjust the cell indexing logic.
- **Multiple Tables**: If your document contains multiple tables, the code will search through all tables for the search string and associated checkboxes.
- **Error Handling**: The code doesn't currently include error handling for cases where the checkboxes are not found or the table structure doesn't match expectations. You may want to add additional checks or logging for these cases.
