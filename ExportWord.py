Chapter 274 Root of All Evil 2

Part 2

Unlike Tino, Lucia did not seem to be bothered at all when she was being cajoled. She clears her throat as if to regain her composure and attacks me.

“Rather than that, we are in this situation because Leader did something strange for Luke, but what are you going to do about it!? If things are this broken, even if I use Magic, I can’t fix it, and more importantly, this dojo has a long history, so just repairing it won’t fix――” (Lucia)

“...... Un, un, that’s right.” (Cry)

“!? Listen to me, pro-per-ly!” (Lucia)

Okay, okay, calm down. There is no such thing as unbreakable things in this world, Lucia. You can’t go back to the past. It is one of the few things I have learned as a Hunter.

Therefore all we can do is live with the memories of the dojo in our hearts.

Feeling enlightened, I was at the mercy of Lucia, who was *gakugaku* coming closer and closer to me, when the senior disciple suddenly said loudly.

“There is no problem! ...... Desu. All this is the result of our immaturity! There is no need for Lucia-san to worry about it, desu!” (Nadori)

He completely flipped sides. And his eyes were staring at Lucia, not at me.

You sound just like Kruz tho’......

In front of me, who was amazed, the senior disciple continued in a loud voice so that everyone could hear him.

It is the same with 《Abyssal Fire of Destruction (Shin En Kametsu)》, why are the old people in this country so energetic............ Please keep staying this healthy.

The disciples were speechless at the question which could not even be called a difficult one, but eventually, the senior disciple lowered his head and said in a stifled voice.

“........................ Kuh. No way, just because I saw the black-haired Magi that I admire, I never thought that I would forget――That I had been captivated by the magic sword and had my body controlled. I am ashamed of the weakness of my heart, desu.” (Nadori)

You should really be ashamed of yourself. Seriously. There are plenty of black-haired Magi out there............ Like Kryhi Andrichhi!

Then I realized that the senior disciple had said something that I couldn’t ignore.

Huh............? I definitely thought that Luke used the magic sword and caused a lot of injuries, but maybe that is not the case?

Thinking calmly, most of the disciples here would not survive if Luke, who is already plenty powerful, used a magic sword.

What, I was worried for nothing. Let’s go home and sleep.

When I turned on my heel and tried to walk past the 《Sword Saint (Kensei)》, a heavy force was suddenly applied to my shoulders.

When I look behind me, our eyes meet. Thawne smiled in a different way than before and started to walk away. ――While holding me.

TL notes:

Thanks for reading!

I updated the cover on the main page to volume 8 cover.

Cry almost escaped thanks to Lucia

What excuse will Cry say in front of the Sword Saint!?

Tchao à plus!
