1. Understand Your Audience

Before diving into the content:

Are they technical (developers, engineers)?

Are they non-technical (PMs, stakeholders)?

What is their experience level with Jira?

2. Define Your Demo Objectives

Clearly outline what you want your team to learn or see. For example:

How your project board is structured (epics, stories, tasks)

How to create/update tickets

Sprint management

Reporting & dashboards

Workflows or automation in place



---

3. Structure Your Jira Demo

Here’s a clear structure you can follow:

I. Introduction (2-3 min)

Quick intro on what Jira is and how your team uses it.

Briefly state your goals for the demo.


II. Jira Project Overview (3-5 min)

Show the project board (Scrum/Kanban).

Explain the issue types (Epic, Story, Task, Bug, Sub-task).

Demonstrate the swimlanes/columns and what they represent (To Do, In Progress, Done).


III. Ticket Lifecycle (5-7 min)

How to create a ticket.

Fields to fill: summary, description, assignee, story points, labels, etc.

Show transition between statuses and explain the workflow.

Mention linked issues and dependencies.


IV. Sprint Management (if using Scrum) (3-5 min)

How to start/end a sprint.

How to prioritize the backlog.

Explain how tasks are assigned and tracked during the sprint.


V. Reporting & Dashboards (2-3 min)

Show useful reports: Burndown chart, velocity chart, cumulative flow diagram.

Brief tour of dashboards if your team uses them.


VI. Tips & Best Practices (optional, 2-3 min)

Naming conventions.

How to use filters or JQL.

Mention any automation (e.g. auto-assign on status change).


VII. Q&A (5-10 min)

4. Preparation Tips

Use a demo project or a copy of your live board (so you don’t accidentally change live data).

Pre-create a few tickets to avoid delays.

Keep it interactive—ask questions or let them try actions (if time allows).
